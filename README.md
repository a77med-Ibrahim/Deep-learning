# 🤔 What is the purpose of this repo?

I wanted to switch from Full-Stack Development to Deep Learning, and what could be better than working on projects by hand and filling my GitHub with projects? 😉  
(*I guess that’s the best way to learn — at least that’s what everyone says.*)

# 😄 Why would you ever want to look at this repo specifically? 

Well...  
You don't *have* to 😁 — but if you do, here’s why it might be worth your time:

## 📝 The reason I made this repo:

As mentioned earlier, I made it to obviously push my Deep Learning projects here. Along with that, I wanted to explain each project in **DETAILS**.

### You might ask, "Why would I ever look at the explanation here when I have ChatGPT? 🤖"

As a person, I understand better when I explain to someone. So I came up with the idea of explaining it to GitHub in my own way — and who knows, people might enjoy a **genuine human explanation**, and I could get a lot of stars 🤷

Please star this repo 👀
